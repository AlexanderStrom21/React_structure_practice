Page-Level Components: Each view usually corresponds to a different page in the app, such as Home, Login, Dashboard, Profile, etc. These components often serve as entry points, containing the main structure for the page and using smaller components from the components folder to build the page’s UI.

Example:

// views/Home.js
import React from 'react';
import Header from '../components/Header';
import Footer from '../components/Footer';
import ContentSection from '../components/ContentSection';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <ContentSection />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
Routing: In applications that use a routing library like React Router, views are typically mapped to specific routes. For example, the Home view might be associated with the /home route, the Profile view with /profile, and so on. The views folder keeps these page-level components organized and makes it easier to manage routes and navigation.

Example:

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './views/Home';
import Profile from './views/Profile';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
    </Routes>
  </Router>
);

export default App;
Layout and Structure: Views often define the layout and structure of each page, setting up sections like headers, footers, sidebars, or any other structural elements that make up the page. They may also handle things like loading states, error boundaries, or conditional rendering based on user data or permissions.

Integration with State and Data Fetching: Since views are often associated with specific sections of the app, they commonly handle data fetching and manage state at a higher level, passing props down to smaller components. Some apps even import services or store functions in views for fetching or updating data needed by the page.

Example with Data Fetching:

// views/Dashboard.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { fetchDashboardData } from '../services/api';
import DashboardCard from '../components/DashboardCard';

const Dashboard = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const result = await fetchDashboardData();
      setData(result);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      {data ? (
        <DashboardCard data={data} />
      ) : (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Dashboard;
Conditional Rendering and Authentication: Views can also handle authentication and access control, making sure certain pages are accessible only to logged-in users or those with specific permissions. This can be done by conditionally rendering content based on authentication status or by redirecting users if they don’t have access.

Example:

// views/ProtectedPage.js
import React from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const ProtectedPage = ({ isAuthenticated }) => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    navigate('/login');
    return null;
  }

  return <div>Welcome to the protected page!</div>;
};

export default ProtectedPage;
Example of a Typical views Folder Structure

src/
├── views/
│   ├── Home.js           # Homepage view
│   ├── Profile.js        # Profile page view
│   ├── Dashboard.js      # Dashboard page view
│   └── Login.js          # Login page view
├── components/
│   ├── Header.js
│   ├── Footer.js
│   └── ContentSection.js
├── App.js
└── index.js
Summary
The views folder organizes page-level components that represent entire sections or screens of the application. These views often handle routing, layout structure, data fetching, and higher-level state management. This keeps the app modular and maintainable by separating page-specific logic from reusable components and smaller UI elements.
